You are to calculate pi. Assume you don't know any algorithms for pi, but you know the area of a circle is pi*d^2/4, and the area of a square is d^2.

Now you have come up with an algorithm to calculate pi. You generate a lot of points in a square which has vertices at (-1, 1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, -1).
∵ The ratio of the area of the circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1 and the square is pi/4
∴ The probability of any point landing inside the circle is pi/4
∴ The ratio of the number of points inside the circle and the number of points is approximately pi/4 (the ratio actually converges to pi/4 as the number of points approaches infinity)

The algorithm takes the number of points as the input, and outputs the result of calculation, i.e. the approximation of pi.

Now in order to generate random points, you are given a built-in function RANDOM() which returns a float between -1 and 1.
(This is not a built-in function in pseudocode, DO NOT use this function in your test!)

Mark Scheme:
	1 point for each correct answer
	0 points for each incorrect answer
	The order may differ, as long as the output is not affected.
