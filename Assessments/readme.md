# Chapter 4 logic gates and logic circuits
#### chapter 4 worksheet191121 with ms  
#### chapter 1 worksheet191122 with ms
### programming project: create your own logic gates and adder in python (DDL: Nov 21 8am)
* logic gates include NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and allow the user to do any combinations with no more than 4 inputs, the program will output the truth table automatically
* logic gates to build an adder, a half adder(4 bits input, 5 bits output -- the additional one is the carry bit) is compulsory, a full adder (8 bits input, 9 bits output -- the additional one is the carry bit) is optional with bonus.

* https://www.cnblogs.com/pacino12134/p/9772687.html 

#### Part A task for you:
* 1. Write program to show a color image in different color depth: 1bit, 4 bits(optional), 8 bits, 24 bits, 32 bits…
* 2. Write a brief report about this investigation: what is color channel and how it affects the image quality

B. Use python to create vector image and compare with bitmap
* https://blog.csdn.net/jwyhappy/article/details/87366577 
* https://blog.csdn.net/xpj8888/article/details/82712238
* https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/sample_plots.html

#### Part B task for you:

Open the .svg format in inkscape and compare with the bitmap in the same scale, 
* 2. Write a brief report about this investigation: what are the features of vector graph and what are the main difference between vector graph and bitmap.

C. Image format in details: bmp, jpg(jpeg), png, gif, webp
* https://blog.csdn.net/jemenchen/article/details/52658476

* 1. Research about the A bitmap file header containing meta data which defines the colour depth and the resolution, etc., write everything you can find out. 
* 2. Write program to create your own bitmap image based on 2D array in python, you can refer to https://github.com/wudithu08/icc-AL-CS-2021/blob/master/Assignments/arrays/exercise.py 
* 3. Try to find a way to visualize the how image is represented in computer. (bonus)
* 4. Write a brief report of different image formats: bmp, jpg(jpeg), png, gif, webp, use a big table to show your results.
* 5. Use python matplotlib to create an image (refer to point 2) and save it as different format, compare the image file size, think about why and write your results.



### 1.4 Sound 
#### project sound
* Reference: https://github.com/wudithu08/icc-AL-CS-2021/blob/master/Assessments/files/Sound%20Wave.rar
* create your own garage band: 探究项目——音频，project music， 用程序创作音乐。要求：为每个音符创建对应频率的sin函数，参见ppt的基本例子。最基本要求，是单声部，用户输入简谱，或者从文件读简谱，计算机生成音乐并自动播放。期待有同学可以做出多声部，甚至不同的乐器效果。总之就是要打造自己的garage band。 ddl同上。
